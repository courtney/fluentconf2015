Algorithms for Animation - Simple formulas to activate your UI

Summary: 
Animations don’t just make things look cool, they provide context and additional details. Animations give us a third dimension with which to communicate: time. The real world doesn’t move in a perfectly linear fashion and when we see things that do, it feels awkward and unnatural. With motion, the difference between dull and delightful often comes down to the math.

This talk walks you through the basic principles of animation design and the simple formulas that can be used to create robust animations. With a quick introduction into interpolation, easing and sequencing you will learn how to create a lot of effects with just a little code. We will also discuss performance considerations when using CSS and JS and current browser capabilities.

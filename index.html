						The purpose of this talk is two fold.

						<p>The meta purpose of this talk to to attempt to bridge the gap between developers and designers.</p> 
						<p>How many of you consider yourselves a designer? Developer? Hybrid?</p>
						<p>Designing animations for software has always been a bit decoupled from the implementation.<br/>
						translating that onto web or mobile is always a bit tricky.</p>

						<p>Windsor McCay working at disney, came up with a way to create cartoon animations</p>

						<p>Traditional disney animation consisted of the best designers creating a few key animation drawings and then a "inbetweener" would draw in the scenes between. This is where keyframe and tween came to be. </p>

						<p>We use software to be the "inbetweener".</p>
						
						<p>So instead of a human determining tbe direction and speed that this figure flips, we've can use math to actually create very organic and natural animations from one state to the next.</p>

						<p>In much the same way, user interfaces can naturally lead people to take the correct steps to accomplish their goals.. this is a signifier or perceived affordance: The concept of affordance derives from cognitive psychology and refers to particular characteristics of an object that guide the viewer.

						<p>Animation has its roots in some very easy math functions.</p>
						<p>Coming up with an easy way to play around with animations can actually be a bit tricky without pulling out Flinto or Adobe Quartz or some bloated framework. </p>						
						<p>I am assuradly not good at math. I can get by, about as well as I can get by in paris with my french. which is to say, i can communicate, i can have some fun, and I can get what I want to get across across. I feel about the same with math and happily have found ways to have fun with it in my coding.</p>

					<h2>The basics of animation: interpolation</h2>
					<!-- <p>Start, Change, Time, Duration</p> -->
					<pre>valueAtTime = (end - start) * time / duration + start</pre>					
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>One simple formula describes all animation. <p>
						
						<p>Once you understand this, you can manipulate your animation without limit.</p>
						
						<p>It is all based on time. You need to know where you are going to start, where you want to go (change), where you are currently, and what the total duration should be for the animation</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Breaking it down to [0-1]</h2>		
					<pre>valueAtTime = (end - start) * time / duration + start</pre>	
					<p>change = end - start</p>			
					<p>percent complete = time/duration</p>					
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>when making some kind of animation, we know the starting and ending positions, and want to transition between these. All of these can be converted to interpolation from 0 to 1.</p>

						- thinking about things in terms of percent complete
						<p>you are trying to map everything into a point of reference between 0 and 1</p>
						<p>multiply any value between 0 and 1 with another value between 0 and 1, and the result is guaranteed to be between 0 and 1.</p>
						this will then work for everything - you will have your different parameters like position, color, shape, etc but you can map them to a value between 0 to 1
						
						<p>So Interpolation allows you to start talking more generally and easily porting over whatever you need to put motion to into a very easy range of reference.</p>

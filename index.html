						The purpose of this talk is two fold. 
						<br/>The first objective is to outline the basic fundamental of animation and how to put it into practice.
						<p>The meta purpose of this talk to to attempt to bridge the gap between developers and designers.</p> 
						<p>Designing animations for software has always been a bit decoupled from the implementation.<br/>
						translating that onto web or mobile is always a bit tricky.</p> 
						At Carbon Five, our designers are able to sit down with developers and play around with animation real time in code. This isn't always practical or feasable. The barrier to diving into that code has always seemed a bit high. There are frameworks that help but require some upfront knowledge and are often more bloated than useful. I'd like to show the basic underpinnings to all animation, talk a bit about the theories behind it and how approachable it can be to integrate motion into a design in a browser.

						How many of you consider yourselves a designer? Developer? Hybrid?

						Traditional disney animation consisted of the best designers creating a few key animation drawings and then a "inbetweener" would draw in the scenes between. This is where keyframe and tween came to be. 

						We use software to be the "inbetweener".
						
						So instead of a human determining how quickly Gertie's head swings from left to right, we've can use math to actually create very organic and natural animations from one state to the next.

					<h2>How do you communicate animation ideas?</h2>									
					<aside class="notes">
						Coming up with an easy way to play around with animations can actually be a bit tricky. There are ways to play with animation without writing a line of code, like Quartz or Adobe After effects or Flinto or some such application. If you are familiar with these programs then they are good for prototyping an animation but it might not translate well to a browser. Within the browser there are also stacks of frameworks out there that help but often with quite a bit of overhead. jQuery I'm looking at you... CSS goes a long way with very simple code but has limitations. Each one of these will have its place, my intention is to give some foundational knowledge about the underlying math that will take you from the world of unnatural right angles and straight lines to smooth, organic movements. Once you have this base you can then explore more and more animation techniques.

						presenting new things where there is no known paradime. you need to introduce a new concept for an interface but you can use familiar animation to help your user make sense of things.

						Animation has its roots in some very easy math functions.
						I am assuradly not good at math. I can get by, about as well as I can get by in paris with my french. which is to say, i can communicate, i can have some fun, and I can get what I want to get across across. I feel about the same with math and happily have found ways to have fun with it in my coding.

			<h2>The basics of animation: interpolation</h2>
			<!-- <p>Start, Change, Time, Duration</p> -->
			<pre>valueAtTime = (end - start) * time / duration + start</pre>
			<aside class="notes">
				a simple formula describes all animation, gives you a better sense of what animation is based on, what easing actually is and what you need to do with it
				This is the underpinnings of all animations
				Once you understand this, you can extend your animation without limit.
				
				All based on time. You need to know where you are going to start, where you want to go (change), where you are currently, and what the total duration should be for the animation
			</aside>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Breaking it down to [0-1]</h2>		
			<pre>valueAtTime = (end - start) * time / duration + start</pre>	
			<p>change = end - start</p>			
			<p>percent complete = time/duration</p>
			<aside class="notes">
				<p>when making some kind of animation, we know the starting and ending positions, and want to transition between these. All of these can be converted to interpolation from 0 to 1.</p>

				- thinking about things in terms of percent complete
				<p>you are trying to map everything into a point of reference between 0 and 1</p>
				<p>multiply any value between 0 and 1 with another value between 0 and 1, and the result is guaranteed to be between 0 and 1.</p>
				this will then work for everything - you will have your different parameters like position, color, shape, etc but you can map them to a value between 0 to 1
				
				<p>So Interpolation allows you to start talking more generally and easily porting over whatever you need to put motion to into a very easy range of reference.</p>

		<aside class="notes">
			I keep talking about this magical 0-1 range... but now we're going to step outside that.
			Being able to go beyond the range prescribed by your property's initial value and final value is a very important detail that can help make your animations more realistic! One of the 12 Basic Principles of Animation is Follow through or elastic movement. Follow through refers to an animation technique where things don't stop animating suddenly. They exceed their final target slightly before snapping back into place. This useful technique is something that can only be done by going beyond the 0-1 range.

		<h2>Tools</h2>			
					
		<aside class="notes">
			So you can see that when animations start to get complicated, the math does start to get a bit more complicated as well. It is worthwhile to take the opportunity to play around with it but there are also lots of options out there to take care of it for you as well. Given the basic knowledge you have now, you can understand better what is going on under the hood.

			Animating in JavaScript does give you a lot of control: starting, pausing, reversing, interrupting and cancelling are trivial. Some effects, like parallax scrolling, can only be achieved in JavaScript.

			CSS: browser can optimize the animation. pushed to GPU.
			<p>position, scale, rotation and opacity</p>
			great for simple animation on interface elements that don't have a lot of interdependency in their transitions

		<h2>Performance</h2>			
		<aside class="notes">
			<p>As far as performance, there is a lot to consider before you can just say CSS is better than JS. 
			CSS gets touted as being more performant because it offloads calculations to a different thread and harnesses the GPU </p>
			<p>JS translate3d or matrix3d.</p>
			<p>specific to Transforms (scale, rotation, translation, and skew) and opacity</p>
			<p>work is in the initial rendering and document layout, css layer won't have to redraw the full canvas. </p>

		<h2>Go forth and animate!</h2>
		<aside class="notes">
			So I'd like to encourage you all to go out and play with animations and with these formulas. See what you can do with just an HTML page and some simple JS functions. Play around with the values and find out what types of animations appeal to you.
